const QUESTIONS = [
  {
    topic: "Definition",
    question: "What best defines an engineering ceramic?",
    choices: [
      "A metallic material with high hardness",
      "An inorganic, non-metallic material with ionic or covalent bonding",
      "A polymer reinforced with fibres",
      "A heat-treated steel"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Engineering ceramics are inorganic, non-metallic materials typically bonded by ionic and/or covalent bonds. These strong bonds give ceramics high hardness, stiffness, and temperature resistance, but also contribute to their brittleness."
  },
  {
    topic: "Atomic Bonding",
    question: "Why do ceramics generally have high hardness and melting temperatures?",
    choices: [
      "They have large grain sizes",
      "They are amorphous",
      "They are held together by strong ionic and covalent bonds",
      "They contain alloying elements"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Ionic and covalent bonds are very strong and directional, requiring large amounts of energy to break. This leads to high hardness, high melting temperatures, and excellent thermal stability."
  },
  {
    topic: "Mechanical Behaviour",
    question: "Why are most engineering ceramics brittle at room temperature?",
    choices: [
      "They have low hardness",
      "They lack effective slip systems for plastic deformation",
      "They contain high carbon",
      "They have low elastic modulus"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Ceramics lack mobile dislocations and slip systems, so they cannot plastically deform to relieve stress. As a result, cracks propagate easily, leading to brittle fracture."
  },
  {
    topic: "Strength in Compression",
    question: "Compared to tensile strength, ceramic materials typically have:",
    choices: [
      "Lower compressive strength",

      "Much higher compressive strength",
      "No compressive strength"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Ceramics are very strong in compression because compressive loading tends to close cracks rather than open them, unlike tensile loading which promotes crack growth."
  },
  {
    topic: "Elastic Modulus",
    question: "How does the elastic modulus of ceramics compare to metals?",
    choices: [
      "Much lower",
      "Similar",
      "Much higher",
      "Zero"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,

      "High ductility at high temperature"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Many ceramics have low thermal conductivity and are used as thermal insulators, though some specialised ceramics (e.g. SiC, AlN) have high thermal conductivity."
  },
  {
    topic: "Thermal Shock",
    question: "Why are ceramics susceptible to thermal shock?",
    choices: [
      "They melt easily",
      "They have low hardness",
      "They have low fracture toughness and limited ability to relieve thermal stresses",
      "They oxidise rapidly"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Rapid temperature changes create thermal stresses. Because ceramics cannot plastically deform and have low fracture toughness, these stresses can cause cracking."
  },
  {
    topic: "Electrical Properties",

      "Low-stress housings"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Silicon carbide has exceptional hardness, high-temperature strength, and thermal conductivity, making it ideal for abrasives, furnace components, and wear parts."
  },
  {
    topic: "Silicon Nitride (Si₃N₄)",
    question: "Why is silicon nitride used in high-speed bearings?",
    choices: [
      "Low hardness",
      "High density",
      "High fracture toughness for a ceramic and good thermal shock resistance",
      "Low cost"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Silicon nitride combines relatively high fracture toughness with low density and good thermal shock resistance, making it suitable for demanding bearing applications."
  },
  {
    topic: "Zirconia (ZrO₂)",
    question: "What unique toughening mechanism is associated with zirconia?",
    choices: [
      "Grain boundary sliding",
      "Transformation toughening",
      "Solid solution strengthening",
      "Work hardening"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Zirconia undergoes a stress-induced phase transformation that absorbs energy and helps blunt cracks, significantly increasing fracture toughness."
  },
  {
    topic: "Fracture Toughness",
    question: "Compared to metals, ceramics generally have:",
    choices: [
      "Higher fracture toughness",
      "Similar fracture toughness",
      "Lower fracture toughness",
      "Infinite fracture toughness"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Ceramics have much lower fracture toughness than metals, meaning they are more sensitive to flaws and cracks."
  },
  {
    topic: "Processing",
    question: "Which manufacturing process is most commonly used to shape engineering ceramics?",
    choices: [
      "Casting and welding",
      "Forging",
      "Powder processing followed by sintering",
      "Hot rolling"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Ceramics are typically formed from powders and densified by sintering, as they cannot be plastically deformed like metals."
  },
  {
    topic: "Porosity",
    question: "Why is porosity undesirable in engineering ceramics?",
    choices: [
      "It increases ductility",
      "It improves thermal conductivity",
      "It reduces strength and fracture toughness",
      "It reduces density only"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Pores act as stress concentrators and crack initiation sites, significantly reducing strength and reliability."
  },
  {
    topic: "Wear Resistance",
    question: "Why do ceramics often outperform metals in abrasive wear applications?",
    choices: [
      "They are softer",
      "They form lubricating oxides",
      "Their high hardness resists abrasive particle penetration",
      "They plastically deform easily"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "The very high hardness of ceramics prevents abrasive particles from cutting or ploughing into the surface."
  },
  {
    topic: "Chemical Stability",
    question: "Which environment are ceramics particularly well suited for?",
    choices: [
      "High-impact environments",
