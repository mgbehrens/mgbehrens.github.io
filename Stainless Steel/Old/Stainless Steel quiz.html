const QUESTIONS = [
  {
    topic: "Definition",
    question: "What is the minimum chromium content required for a steel to be classified as stainless steel?",
    choices: ["5%", "8%", "10.5%", "15%"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "A minimum of approximately 10.5% chromium is required to form a continuous, self-healing chromium oxide (Cr₂O₃) passive layer. This passive film is what gives stainless steel its corrosion resistance."
  },
  {
    topic: "Corrosion Resistance",
    question: "Why does chromium improve corrosion resistance in stainless steel?",
    choices: [
      "It increases hardness only",
      "It forms a passive oxide layer on the surface",
      "It removes carbon from the steel",
      "It makes the steel non-magnetic"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Chromium reacts with oxygen to form a thin, stable chromium oxide layer that protects the underlying metal. If damaged, this passive layer can reform in the presence of oxygen."
  },
  {
    topic: "Austenitic Stainless Steel",
    question: "Which crystal structure is associated with austenitic stainless steels?",
    choices: ["BCC", "FCC", "HCP", "Simple cubic"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Austenitic stainless steels have an FCC crystal structure, which contributes to their high ductility, toughness, and excellent formability."
  },
  {
    topic: "Alloying Elements",
    question: "Which element is primarily responsible for stabilising the austenitic (FCC) structure in stainless steel?",
    choices: ["Chromium", "Carbon", "Nickel", "Molybdenum"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Nickel stabilises the austenitic (FCC) phase at room temperature, preventing transformation to ferrite or martensite and improving toughness."
  },
  {
    topic: "Grades",
    question: "Which stainless steel grade is commonly referred to as \"18/8\"?",
    choices: ["410", "430", "304", "316"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Grade 304 typically contains approximately 18% chromium and 8% nickel, giving rise to the term 18/8 stainless steel."
  },
  {
    topic: "Molybdenum",
    question: "What is the primary benefit of adding molybdenum to stainless steel (e.g. 316 vs 304)?",
    choices: [
      "Increased hardness",
      "Improved resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion",
      "Improved machinability",
      "Increased magnetic properties"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Molybdenum significantly improves resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion, particularly in chloride-rich environments such as marine or chemical processing applications."
  },
  {
    topic: "Magnetism",
    question: "Why are most austenitic stainless steels non-magnetic in the annealed condition?",
    choices: [
      "They contain no iron",
      "They have an FCC crystal structure",
      "They contain high carbon",
      "They are fully hardened"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "The FCC crystal structure of austenitic stainless steels is non-magnetic. However, cold working can induce some martensite and cause slight magnetism."
  },
  {
    topic: "Ferritic Stainless Steel",
    question: "Which crystal structure is associated with ferritic stainless steels?",
    choices: ["FCC", "BCC", "HCP", "Amorphous"],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Ferritic stainless steels have a BCC crystal structure, similar to ferrite in carbon steels, which makes them magnetic and limits their ductility compared to austenitic grades."
  },
  {
    topic: "Ferritic Properties",
    question: "Which property is characteristic of ferritic stainless steels?",
    choices: [
      "Excellent toughness at low temperatures",
      "High nickel content",
      "Magnetic behaviour",
      "Ability to be hardened by heat treatment"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Ferritic stainless steels are magnetic due to their BCC structure and generally contain little to no nickel."
  },
  {
    topic: "Martensitic Stainless Steel",
    question: "Which type of stainless steel can be hardened by heat treatment?",
    choices: ["Austenitic", "Ferritic", "Martensitic", "Duplex"],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Martensitic stainless steels contain higher carbon and can form martensite on quenching, allowing them to be hardened and tempered."
  },
  {
    topic: "Martensitic Applications",
    question: "Which application commonly uses martensitic stainless steel?",
    choices: [
      "Food processing tanks",
      "Surgical instruments and knives",
      "Heat exchangers",
      "Marine fasteners"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Martensitic stainless steels offer high hardness and strength, making them suitable for cutting tools, knives, and surgical instruments."
  },
  {
    topic: "Duplex Stainless Steel",
    question: "What microstructure characterises duplex stainless steels?",
    choices: [
      "Fully austenitic",
      "Fully ferritic",
      "A mixture of ferrite and austenite",
      "Martensite and bainite"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Duplex stainless steels contain roughly equal amounts of ferrite and austenite, combining high strength with good corrosion resistance."
  },
  {
    topic: "Duplex Properties",
    question: "What is a key advantage of duplex stainless steels?",
    choices: [
      "Very high carbon content",
      "Excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking",
      "Ease of heat treatment",
      "Non-magnetic behaviour"

    explanation: "The mixed microstructure of duplex stainless steels provides high strength and excellent resistance to stress corrosion cracking."
  },
  {
    topic: "Carbon Content",
    question: "Why is carbon content generally kept low in austenitic stainless steels?",
    choices: [
      "To reduce density",
      "To prevent carbide precipitation and intergranular corrosion",
      "To increase hardness",
      "To improve machinability"
    ],
    correctIndex: 1,
    explanation: "Excess carbon can combine with chromium to form chromium carbides at grain boundaries, reducing corrosion resistance (sensitisation)."
  },
  {
    topic: "Low-Carbon Grades",
    question: "What does the 'L' designation in grades such as 304L or 316L indicate?",
    choices: [
      "Low strength",
      "Low alloy content",
      "Low carbon content",
      "Low corrosion resistance"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "The 'L' indicates low carbon content, which reduces the risk of sensitisation during welding."
  },
  {
    topic: "Welding",
    question: "Why are low-carbon or stabilised stainless steels preferred for welded structures?",
    choices: [
      "They are cheaper",
      "They are harder",
      "They reduce the risk of intergranular corrosion",
      "They eliminate distortion"
    ],
    correctIndex: 2,
    explanation: "Low-carbon or stabilised grades prevent chromium carbide formation during welding, maintaining corrosion resistance."
  },
  {
    topic: "Strengthening",
    question: "How are austenitic stainless steels typically strengthened?",
    choices: [
      "Heat treatment only",
      "Cold working",
